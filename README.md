# Advanced-Classification-of-Animal-Sounds-using-Spectrogram-Analysis.-

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model to classify animal sounds from spectrograms. Utilizing advanced audio processing techniques and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras, the model aims to distinguish between various categories of animal sounds, including household pets, farm animals, and wild animals.
