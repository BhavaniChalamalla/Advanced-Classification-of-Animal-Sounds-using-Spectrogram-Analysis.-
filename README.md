# Advanced Classification of Animal Sounds using Spectrogram Analysis.-

## Project Overview
Our project focuses on the development of a machine learning model to classify animal sounds from spectrograms. Utilizing advanced audio processing techniques and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras, the model aims to distinguish between various categories of animal sounds, including household pets, farm animals, and wild animals.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises over 150 audio recordings of animal sounds, sourced from platforms such as YouTube and Google's AudioSet. The sounds are categorized into:

Household Pets (Dogs, Cats)
Farm Animals (Sheep, Goats)
Wild Animals (Big Cats, Wild Dogs)

Each audio file is processed to extract Mel Spectrograms and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which serve as the input features for the machine learning model.
